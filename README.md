Inputs:
I completed the challenge "Input Component" from  [https://devchallenges.io/]. I tried to make it with some changes. I used some props for customize the inputs with colors, size or direction. Also I used some components children to compartmentalize the differents inputs. On this way I have a cleaner code on each component.  

Dependencies: 
**Material Symbols**
        -To install: `npm install material-symbols@latest`
        -To use:
                Enter on : [https://fonts.google.com/icons]
                Search the icon that you need, and write the name and write on icon prop, like this:
                        **example: icon={'support_agent'}**


__Usage__:
Import Input component o the component where you want to. After, use the component with this estructure: 
                **<Input />**

**Modifier inputs:**
Use the input's props
        state: available inputs 
                default, helper text, multiline, icon or disabled.

        type: input's html type
                text, number, password, email, etc...
        color: input's theme
                error, blue, green, purple
        size: input's size
                full-width

**Modifier icon inputs**:
        iconDirection : icon's location
                left, right
        icon: type the icon's name from [https://fonts.google.com/icons] 
        If it is more than one word write it with lower and snake case, like this:
                 **support_agent**
